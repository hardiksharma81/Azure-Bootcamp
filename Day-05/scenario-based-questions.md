## 🚀 1. Tell me about yourself

I'm a results-driven Senior DevOps Engineer with over 4 years of hands-on experience in building scalable, secure, and cost-efficient cloud infrastructure, primarily on AWS.

I specialize in automation, CI/CD optimization, and Kubernetes-based microservices management.
In my recent projects, I’ve focused on observability (Datadog, ELK, CloudWatch) and self-healing infrastructure patterns using Terraform and Lambda automation.

I enjoy bridging development and operations by enabling faster, safer, and more reliable deployments — aligning infrastructure goals with business outcomes.

##  ☁️ 2. What’s your approach to designing a scalable cloud architecture?

When designing scalable architectures:

🧩 Start with modularity: Break workloads into microservices or independent units.

⚙️ Use autoscaling: Configure ECS/EKS or ASGs to adapt to load.

🌍 Leverage multi-AZ & region redundancy for HA and DR.

💾 Use managed services like RDS, S3, and CloudFront for reliability.

🔐 Apply IAM least privilege and automate security scanning (e.g., Terraform + AWS Config).

💰 Optimize cost: Right-size compute, use Savings Plans, and enable lifecycle policies.

📈 In short: scalable = modular + automated + observable + secure.

## 🧱 3. How do you manage infrastructure as code (IaC) using Terraform?

I structure Terraform projects with clear modules, environments, and workspaces.

I use remote backends (S3 + DynamoDB) for state management.

Git-based workflows (PRs, code reviews) ensure version control and peer validation.

I implement Terraform Cloud/Atlantis pipelines for automated plan & apply steps.

Security validation: run tfsec and checkov scans pre-deploy.

🧩 Goal: every infra change should be reproducible, reviewable, and revertible.

## 🐳 4. How do you handle Kubernetes in production?

Use EKS (or GKE) with GitOps via ArgoCD for declarative deployments.

Apply resource limits, node affinity, taints/tolerations for stability.

Use HPA/VPA for scaling and PodDisruptionBudgets for availability.

Logging & monitoring through Prometheus + Grafana + Loki / Datadog APM.

Secure via network policies, secrets encryption (KMS), and RBAC policies.

🎯 Treat Kubernetes as a platform — automate, observe, and secure everything.

##  🔄 5. How do you approach CI/CD pipeline optimization?

I use GitHub Actions / CircleCI for multi-stage pipelines (build → test → deploy).

Add parallel jobs for speed, caching for dependencies, and auto rollbacks on failure.

Use feature-based environments via dynamic namespaces.

Embed security checks (SAST, dependency scans) early in CI.

Enable blue-green or canary deployments for zero-downtime delivery.

💡 Fast pipelines don’t just deliver code — they deliver confidence.

##  🔍 6. How do you ensure observability and reliability in production?

Implement Datadog + CloudWatch metrics + structured logging (JSON).

Set up SLO-based alerts — not just threshold-based noise.

Use synthetic monitoring for critical user journeys.

Integrate incident automation with PagerDuty or OpsGenie.

Track MTTR, MTTD, and perform post-incident RCA reviews.

🔭 You can’t improve what you can’t see — observability is not optional.

##  🔐 7. How do you handle secrets and sensitive data?

Store all secrets in AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault.

Enable automatic rotation (Lambda or native rotation) for credentials.

Use KMS for encryption at rest and TLS for data in transit.

Restrict access via IAM policies and scoped-down permissions.

🧰 No hardcoded secrets. Ever.

##  💸 8. How do you approach AWS cost optimization?

Enable Cost Explorer + Budgets for daily insights.

Use Compute Optimizer for right-sizing EC2/ECS workloads.

Implement lifecycle policies for S3 and EBS snapshots.

Use Reserved Instances / Savings Plans for stable workloads.

Auto-stop non-prod environments after hours with Lambda schedulers.

🧮 Every dollar saved in ops is a dollar that fuels innovation.

##  🧠 9. Tell me about a recent challenge you solved.

In one project, memory usage on multiple ECS services exceeded 85%, causing restarts.
I automated a self-healing workflow using CloudWatch alarms → EventBridge → Lambda → ECS force deployment.

Result:

🚀 Reduced manual ops load by 80%.

🧠 Prevented service downtime proactively.

📉 Achieved consistent uptime without human intervention.

This experience taught me how automation drives both stability and team velocity.
